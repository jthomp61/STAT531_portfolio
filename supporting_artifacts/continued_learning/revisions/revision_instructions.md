Your visualization is an interesting idea, but digesting what you are plotting 
is a bit difficult. First, as a Statistician, I'm inclined to believe line plots 
connect continuous points, but there is no reason to believe the observations 
between LA and SF are continuous.

Just brainstorming here, but it seems like you want to juxtapose the 
relationship between avocados sold, money spend on avocados, and home price by 
city. It cold be more clear to to a scatter plot for the relationship  between 
the mean price of homes and the average money spent on avocados. You could then 
color (or annotate!) the cities.

You've got a great start to your Challenges! I'd like for you to attend to my 
comments / suggestions above in your revisions.

Fist I decided to keep year as a variable so I had 4 average points over those
4 years for home prices and average avocados sold. 

Then, I went for a scatterplot instead of the line graph from before. That made 
it much easier to view the differences of amount of avg. avocados sold and avg. 
home prices.And, honestly viewing the graph then made it clear LA just loves 
avocados and had low avg home pries for those years in comparison to SF.
