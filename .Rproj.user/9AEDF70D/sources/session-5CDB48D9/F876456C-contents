Reviewing code

-   plot titles only use if it tells you something new

-   Name arguments: example xlab = , ylab = , color =

`plot(cars)` vs `plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist)`

-   plot does not have a `data =` argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cty)
             )
```

-   named arguments

-   white space

-   return the ending parentheses so you know here the function ends

-   code not longer than 80 characters

    -   global options, display, margin (choose margin column)

Load in data using here package

Use R projects

`here::here` the second here is a function, the first here is the package here\
OR

`library(here)`

`here()` dont need to call the here package with the `here::`

Why use here?

-   uses the exact same path

`geom_boxplot(), + geom_jitter(color = "tomato")`
