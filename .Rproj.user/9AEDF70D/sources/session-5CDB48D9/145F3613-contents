[**Additional Evidence:**]{.underline}

I have invested a lot of time and effort into this class and I believe it shows.

First, I have achieved S marks an nearly all my assignments expect for 1, as well as have submitted a majority of my assignments on time (except for a few preview activities).

Second, I have extended my thinking on all my challenge problems, taking what I learned in class and finding solutions to those novel problems by experimenting and trying different approaches even if my end result didn't quite work out. When that happened, I would ask for help in my assignment and revise it next week with the suggestions given.

    -   Challenge 4 **REVISED** for portfolio

    -   Challenge 7

    -   Lab 8 (styling the song)

    -   Lab 9 (after table formatting)

Third, as briefly mentioned in my second point I have demonstrated revising of my thinking. Whenever I received feedback to revise my assignment I would. Most of the time they were small revisions of me misinterpreting a question or not using something correctly. I did have one revision during week 7 for Lab 7 where I used a superseded function, and remembered i needed to check that before I use a function I find. Also in that assignment I received feedback of redundancy, and remebered I could make a temp variable in a function or calculation so I do not have to repeat lines of code (and thus having that repeated line of code run multiple times to get the same calculation). This is imaged below!

Forth, I have demonstrated contributions to the classroom and my team. I was present for class and came prepared for class each week by doing the preview activities at least before each class. I also asked questions on behalf of my team and for myself when needed. Outside of class, I answered questions and gave helpful information on discord when I was able (see images below). As well as answer questions to my group members via a group chat whenever they had questions.
