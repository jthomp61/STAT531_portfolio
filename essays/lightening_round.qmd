**Lightning round**: Answer each of the following questions with **one sentence** including a brief explanation.

1.  "If \[Student\] doesn't earn an A, then nobody should, because..."

    -   Not sure how I like this question. I don't know many students in the class or how they are doing. I also think 'grades' especially in this class are not based on a specific individual setting **the** bar, but rather how a single individual evolves through their own learning style and timeframe needed.

2.  What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.

    -   Thinking of ways to visualize data from a data set. What graph/graphs best to use to represent the variables you want to show and how to make the visualizaiton look pleasant to the viewer.

3.  What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.

    -   Finding motivation to do the assignments! They were really fun to do and felt very rewarding once completed.

4.  What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.

    -   

5.  Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 that will help them be successful in learning.
