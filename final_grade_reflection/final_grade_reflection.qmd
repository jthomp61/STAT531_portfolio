    -   lab 9 all of step 4

1.  **What else?** There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn't explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you're thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough --- and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.

## Continued Learning

\(1\) choose Challenge assignments which demonstrate evidence of how you extended what you learned in class, and (2) choose problems where you were required to submit revisions. Your revised problems should include a description of how you revised your thinking when completing the revision.

I have demonstrated a commitment to my continued learning by attempting every challenge so far. **Challenge4**

\>\>\>\>\> from last reflection

... by extending my thinking from what I learned in class though lab and challenge problems by attempting everything and adding flare if I find something interesting. So far, I have earned S marks on all my assignments and have not had a chance to demonstrate my ability to revise my thinking. However, for this week's lab assignment I am implementing feedback given from the previous week to further bolster my plots.

## Contribution to the Classroom and my Team Community

...to be finished... add screen shots of code used to assist team members and discord

\>\>\>\>\> from last reflection

I try to encourage others and ask how they are doing on assignments via group chat to make sure no one is being left behind. However, for our Tuesday group assignments I could try to be a better recorder/reporter although it is difficult to find the time to record our group session as we go.

I do feel I have been going toward my goals I have set at the beginning of the class, learning how to use rStudio, make documents, and take data and turn it into easy visualizations and tables. Overall, I have been really enjoying the class and playing around with the quarto docs and coding with r. It is very satisfying figuring out how to get exactly what you want with some code that is easy to understand.
